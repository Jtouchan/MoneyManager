**MoneyManager**
===================


# Functionality:

The MoneyManager application is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Preprocess and compile information from two credit card statements into one main excel file (Spending Summary.xlsx) for any given month.

2. Read the compiled monthly statements line by line and break down spending into several categories as specified by the user.

3. If the category of a certain expense is unknown, the application asks the user to choose a category (see below). Once the user makes a selection, the application saves this selection and automatically identifies the category of the expense next time it is encountered. If the user wishes not to include a specific expense in the analysis, he/she can simply skip this step.

4. Once the application is done parsing the compiled monthly statements, it generates visual representations of the spending in the specified month. In addition, it compares the spending in a certain month with that in previous months. (Figures below were produced using dummy data)

5. Finally, the application displays the "big picture" that summarizes the financial activity for the specified month.

# Side Note: 

* This application was inspired by a book titled "Your money or your life" by Vicki Robin who emphasized the importance of tracking _every penny_ spent in order to have a financially healthy life.

**MoneyManager**
===================

The MoneyManager application is designed to perform the following tasks:

# Functionality #:


1. Preprocess and compile credit card statements for a certain month from two banks into the main excel file (##file name##) in preparation for analysis.

2. Parse the compiled monthly statements, and break down spendings into several catagories specified by the user.

3. If the catagory of a certain expense is not previously identified by the user, the application asks the user to choose a catagory for the expense. If the user wishes not to include a specific expense in the analysis, he/she can simply skip this step. Once the user makes a selection, the application saves this selection and automatically identifies the catagory of the expense next time it is encountered.

4. Once the application is done parsing the monthly statements, it generates graphs depicting how much of monthly income was spent on each of the catagories specified by the user. In addition, it compares the spending of a certain month with spendings of previous months. (Figures below were produced using dummy data)

5. Finally, the application displays the "big picture" which summerises the financial activity in a certain month.

(TODO: maybe upload the main excel file after removing some stuff from it)
(make sure there are no typos in here)
